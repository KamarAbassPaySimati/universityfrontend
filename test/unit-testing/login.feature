@1.1 @Login
Feature: Paymaart - Admin Web - Login
    As a Super/finance/support/admin, I want an option to log in so that I can access the application.
    Conditions of Satisfaction:
    User should be able to log in using a registered email address and password.
    If the admin enters an invalid email address or password, an appropriate error message should be displayed.
    The valid email address should be provided by paymaart which should have domain name paymaart.net/ .com
    Once the admin enters the valid email address and password users logging in should be prompted to enter the generated code from their MFA(google authenticator) in addition to their password.
    The system should verify the entered MFA code for authentication.
    After a successful login, the admin will be redirected to the homepage.
    The scan QR code for MFA authentication should be shown only for the first-time login, later it is only the OTP to be received.
