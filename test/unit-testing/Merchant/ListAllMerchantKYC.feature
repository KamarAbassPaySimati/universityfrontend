Feature: Paymaart - Admin Web -Merchant KYC verification Listing Page
    Description
    As a super admin/admin, I want the ability to view a list of agents awaiting manual KYC verification.
    Condition of Satisfaction
    By default, the list should be in a chronological order
    There should be an option to search based on Paymaart ID and Name
    There should be an option to sort based on date and time and filter based on KYC type and status
    Pagination is required if there are more than 10 KYC lists.
    There should be an option to see the total number of records eg: 10/100
    The queue should categorize customers, agents, and merchants separately for clear identification.

    Information to be displayed:
    Paymaart ID
    Paymaart Name
    Submission date
    KYC type( full, simplified)
