Feature: Paymaart - Admin Web- Update Agent from Simplified to Full KYC
    As a Super/Admin, I want an option to Update Agent to FULL KYC

    Conditions of Satisfaction

    If the user selects the Full KYC option , only the ID details and Income section should be displayed to add details, and upload documents, the remaining fields should be auto-filed by the system and editable.

    Upon successfully performing the updation of the user KYC, it should be submitted to the admin for verification.

    This option is enable only if simplified KYC is approved
