Feature: Paymaart - Admin Web- View List of Flagged Transaction
        As an super admin, I want the ability to view all flagged transactions by merchants, agents, admins and customers in case of suspected fraud or user queries

        Conditions of satisfaction

        By default the list should be in a chronological order
        There should be an option to filter using flagged reasons
        Pagination is required if there are more than 10 flagged transactions.
        There should be an option to see the total number of records eg: 10/100
        A confirmation prompt should be displayed before the action is performed.
        There should be an option to enter the comment which is a free text for approval/rejection/refund.
        When a flagged transaction is approved, rejected, or refunded the system should resolve the flag.
        When a refund action is taken, e-money is to be refunded fully to the respective sender.
    Notification to be sent to the relevant parties. based on the membership type
