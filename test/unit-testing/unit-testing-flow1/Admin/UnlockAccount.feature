Feature: Paymaart - Admin Web - Unlock account
As a Super Admin,
I want to unlock a user’s account(Customer,Agent,Merchant)
So that they can access the Paymaart Application.
Conditions of Satisfaction
An "Unlock" option must be available in the admin application.
When the "Unlock" option is selected, random security questions should be displayed.
The admin must enter responses provided by the user.
If the admin provides two correct answers, the system will display a “Forgot PIN/Password” reset link.
When clicked, the reset link should be sent to the user’s registered email.
If incorrect answers are provided for all five questions, the account will be locked again for 24hours.
