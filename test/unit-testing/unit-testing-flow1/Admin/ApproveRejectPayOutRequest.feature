Feature: Paymaart- Admin Web-Approve/Reject Pay-out Request
  As a Super Admin/finance admin, I want to review and approve/reject pay-out transactions initiated by Agent or merchant
  Conditions of satisfaction
  Super Admins should have the authority to approve or reject a pay-out transaction based on their assessment of its legitimacy.
  Once approved, the pay-out should be reflected in the recipient's bank account, and the transaction status should be updated to Approved.
  If rejected, the transaction status should be updated to Rejected and there should be an option to enter the reason for rejection
  appropriate notifications (email/sms/push notiifcation)should be sent to the agent/merchant as per the membership type
  The system should maintain a clear audit trail of all debit transactions, including their approval status and any related actions taken by Super Admins.
  The approved and rejected transactions to be present in the list
  Once approved the transaction ID should be changed from MCR to MCT and AGR to AGT
  Before approval or rejection there should be a confirmation prompt.
