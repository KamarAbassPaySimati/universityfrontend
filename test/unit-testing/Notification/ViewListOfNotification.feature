Feature: Paymaart - Admin Web - Notification Page
    As an Super/finance/support/admin/, I want to have a notification page where I can view important updates relevant to the platform, so that I can stay informed about any critical events or changes that may impact the system or users.

    Conditions of Satisfaction

    The notification page should display a list of notifications sorted by date, with the most recent notifications appearing at the top.

    Each notification should include relevant details such as the date/time it was posted, the type of notification and a brief description or summary.

    The notification page should support pagination or infinite scrolling to accommodate a large number of notifications.

    There should be an option to view the notification and perform the necessary action

    On the tap of notification it should be redirected to the respective notification page

    Once notification is performed with any action then the notification will be removed.
